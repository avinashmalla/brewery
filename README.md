### Search Breweries by cities

This app was created as an assignment for React. It uses the [**Breweries** API](https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries) from [Open Brewerey DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/). The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

The app has three main components
- SearchBrewers: This is the front page. Lists all the breweries with a short info of each in cards. The cards also have a *View Details* button to show more details. There is a search bar to filter breweries by city. 
- BreweryCard: Prepares the cards to be shown on the front page.
- BreweryDetails: Shows more details of each brewery.
